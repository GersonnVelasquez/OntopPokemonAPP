# PokeApp

This project is using ANGULAR version 16.2.0 <- Sorry about this, the instructions say 15

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Additional Information
The application has lint and prettier configured, so you can run `npm run lint` or `ng lint` and `npm run prettier` to check the code.

The application has a very basic global error handler.

The application has a modular architecture following the Angular style core, shared and feature modules.

The application has lazy loading for the feature modules.

I'm using NgRx with the store, effects, selectors, actions, reducers and entities.
